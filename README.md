# Cs360
Repo for my CS360 work 
This repository has my finished mobile app code and design from Project Three. It shows the full event-tracking app I built, based on the UI design I started in Project Two. This project highlights how I used user-centered design and mobile app development best practices to create a working, user-friendly app.
Reflection
App Summary and Goals

The goal of my app was to make an event-tracking tool that was easy and quick for users to manage their schedules. It was designed to meet the need for a clean, simple way to add events, see upcoming plans, and keep everything organized without getting overwhelmed.
Screens, Features, and User-Centered Design

I built a login screen, an event list screen, and an event creation screen. I kept the design focused on making sure users could get where they needed to go fast — with clear buttons, logical layouts, and no extra clutter. I think the design worked well because users wouldn’t need to spend extra time figuring things out; everything feels familiar and easy to use.
How I Coded the App

When coding the app, I broke it down into small pieces and worked screen-by-screen. I tried to keep everything modular so each screen handled its own tasks. This made it easier to catch mistakes and stay organized. In future projects, I’ll definitely use this same step-by-step method — it helped a lot with staying on track.
Testing and Why It Was Important

I tested my app often, usually after making even small changes, just to make sure everything was working right. Testing early and often helped me spot small problems before they turned into big ones. It also helped me realize how much even small user experience details — like error messages — can affect the overall feel of the app.
Overcoming Challenges

One of the bigger challenges was making sure users couldn’t create an event with missing details. I had to go back and add input validation and pop-up messages so users knew exactly what they needed to fix before saving. It took a little extra work but made the app way better in the end.
Where I Felt Most Successful

The event creation feature is where I felt like I really showed my skills. It brought together everything: user input, validation, navigation, and design thinking. I’m proud of how smooth it turned out, and I know it’s something I can build on for bigger projects later.
